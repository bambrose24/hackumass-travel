================

hackathon-planners, here is code to create a spreadsheet that will show the closest 2000 schools to you with Google Maps driving time and miles.

To use this, fork and open in Eclipse. Make sure you have an internet connection in which you do not mind the data flow.
Then run and follow the prompts.

For HackUMass people, enter "0" for every prompt and you will retain UMass info without having to look up longitude, school code etc.
